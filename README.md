# Datathon01
Our team built a supervised learning model to predict average loan distribution using XGBoost with Randomized Search for optimization. With strong feature engineering and model tuning, we achieved high accuracy, identifying key loan trends. Our efforts earned us the Best Supervised Model award at the AI-X Datathon
